## 1- runtime error if user press enter (null reference exception)
    handled by making constructor that intilize the the field of the Sale class
## 2- runtime error (out of range exception)
    solving out of range exception in class InputParse in Join function, by replace 
    the fourth parameter (wordCount) with (wordCount - 2) so we only take the product name
    and escape first and last word with refere to count and price
## #- runtime error (null reference exception)
    the case that handle that the user should type at least 4 word, is handled in a wrong way
    in class InputParse
